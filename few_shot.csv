Question,Answer and Reasoning
"A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency room with testicular
torsion, in extreme pain. Emergency surgery is scheduled, but the
urologist will be unable to see the patient for at least one hour. He
asks that the patient not be given any pain medication, so that
""consent can be obtained"" when he sees the patient.
Are the surgeon's concerns about informed consent valid?

a. Yes, because the surgeon has to obtain informed consent
from the patient before surgery and the pain medication will
invalidate the consent.
b. Yes, because the hospital policy requires the presence of
informed consent from a lucid person before surgery.
c. The informed consent is not required in this case because it is
an emergency.
d. The surgeon concerns are not valid because severe pain, by
impairing a patient's ability to listen and understand, is an
encumbrance to the informed consent process. ","Answer: d. Reasoning: The surgeon has the common misconception that informed consent is somehow invalidated by the presence
of specific medications. Patients who present for surgery may have taken a variety of medications, many of
which can have effects on mental function. The issue is not whether the patient has been premedicated, but
whether premedication has impaired the patient's ability to participate in the informed consent process.
The ethical issues involved in this case include assessment of the patient's capacity to make decisions, and
whether the patient is deliberately or otherwise, being coerced into consenting for surgery. The patient's
capacity to provide consent is determined not by what recent medications have been given, but by whether
the patient understands the need for treatment, can listen to and understand treatment options and risks, and
can then express a choice regarding their care. Respect for patient autonomy requires that we promote a
patient's ability to make an ""unencumbered"" choice. Severe pain, by impairing a patient's ability to listen
and understand, is an encumbrance to the informed consent process. Further, withholding pain medication
for the purpose of obtaining consent might be coercive."
"Your 36-year-old patient has just tested positive for HIV. He asks that
you not inform his wife of the results and claims he is not ready to
tell her yet.
What would you say to your patient?
a. Encourage the patient to share the information with his wife on
his own, giving him a bit more time if necessary.
b. Tell the patient that his wife is at serious risk for being infected
with HIV, and that you have a duty to ensure that she knows of
the risk.
c. Tell the patient that public health law requires reporting both
the patient and any known sexual partners to local health
officers.
d. All the above. ","Answer: d
Reasoning: Because the patient's wife is at serious risk for being infected with HIV, you have a duty to ensure thatshe
knows of the risk. While public health law requires reporting both your patient and any known sexual
partners to local health officers, it is generally advisable to encourage the patient to share this information
with his wife on his own, giving him a bit more time if necessary."
"A 75-year-old woman shows signs of abuse that appears to be inflicted by her husband. As he is her primary caregiver, she feels dependent on him and pleads with you not to say anything to him about it. How would you handle this situation?
a. This is a case of elder abuse and the doctor is required to always report incidents of abuse to the authorities. 
b. The doctor is not permitted under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) to report the abuse. 
c. The laws supporting reporting elder abuse allow the doctor to break confidentiality and report suspected abuse. 
d. The patient should not be reported. Instead, she should obtain support and access to other services in order to maintain her primary caregiver.","Answer: c
Reasoning: In this case, the required reporting laws can be interpreted in a number of justifiable ways. The laws
supporting reporting elder abuse (and child abuse) allow you to break confidentiality and report suspected
abuse. However, if you think it is possible to give this woman support and access to other services without
reporting the case immediately, those alternatives will help her more in the long run. Either way, you have
an obligation to address her abusive situation.
